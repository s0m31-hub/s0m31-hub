I hate writing markdown files. I love listening to music.

I mostly use Java and Kotlin. Also a bit into C# and C++, but those repos are private since they are ~~shit~~ too good to be true. 

Can do gamedev and android dev (private repos again), backend. I am also a bit into frontend development, but I hate it so i prefer using Java servlets instead.
